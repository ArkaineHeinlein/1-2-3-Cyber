# THE GAME

## Two ways to play

__With a facilitator :__
The part is punctuated by interventions and moments of exchanges aiming at reflecting in a playful way on the uses and dangers of the Internet as well as the good reflexes to adopt accordingly.

__In autonomy :__
Players simply want to spend a good time guessing and make people guess words related to cyber security.

## Role of the facilitator
The facilitator plays a __key role__ in the first variant of this game. Indeed, he will have to __facilitate exchanges with and between the players, __orient the discussions in order to deduce the good practices to adopt on the Internet.__

It contains __the detailed rules of the game__ as well as a __guide__ allowing him/her to bounce back on certain key terms and good practices that will have to be shared. 

## Contents of the game
* An animator's booklet
* 35 playing cards
* A buzzer and an hourglass
* A giant poster and a pen
* Several sheets and markers

##### Recommended device : 
Between 6 and 12 players from 11 to 14 years old.
### Duration : 
Introduction + Game + Review = 75 minutes

--------

# UNWOUND OF THE GAME

## 1 - Introduction - 10 min

The aim of this introduction is to __make players aware of the multitude of uses they make of the Internet__ since the Internet covers a very wide range of uses: social networks, online games, search engines, etc.

During this first exchange session, __the children reflect and exchange on their practices and activities on the Internet.__ The facilitator launches the topics by asking questions and following up to get as many answers as possible.

#### Some ideas for conducting the discussions

_Today we're going to play "1,2,3 Cyber!" The goal is simple: make your team guess as many words related to the Internet as possible. But before we start, let's talk about the Internet !_
* What do you do on the Internet?
* What electronic devices do you have? What do you do on them?
* What applications do you use?
* Who do you communicate with online?
* What data do you share online? With whom do you communicate online? Why do you share it?

__The facilitator writes__ on the flipchart the practices and activities shared by the players, repeating them aloud for confirmation by the players.

In principle, the following practices and activities are likely to be mentioned:
* __Social Networks :__ Instagram, TikTok, Youtube, blogs
* __Communication channels :__ WhatsApp, Messenger, Snapchat, Skype, etc.
* __ Online Games :__ Fortnite Overwatch, League of Legend (LoL), Call of Duty (CoD) Fifa, etc.
* __Online Forums__
* __Online download and streaming__

> Before starting the game, it is important to reread what has been shared, ask the players if they can think of other practices and activities, and then complete if necessary. 
Put this list aside and start the game.

------

## 2 - The game- 45 min
The game is played in __3 sets__ made up of __several 45-second rounds__.

__Goal :__ In each round, a different player makes his teammates guess as many cards as possible (one word to be guessed per card).

A round ends when all the words in play have been guessed.

The way in which the words are guessed varies from round to round - details are given on pages 8 and 9.

#### Preparation of the game
The first step is to __divide the group into teams.__
The number of teams will have to be adapted according to the number of players from 2 to 3 teams of 3 to 5 players each.

The facilitator begins by asking the players to choose themselves a team name, preferably with an Internet link. They put them on the scoreboard.

Among the 35 cards available, __form a deck of 15 cards.__
These same 15 cards will be used during the 3 rounds, the goal being that the players get the most out of them.

__To make up the 15-card deck, choose :__
* __The following 10 words:__ *cyberstalking, fake news, phishing, virtual friend, privacy, password, reporting, blackmail, challenge, cell phone.*
Important messages are associated with these words and should therefore be the subject of interventions by the facilitator as the game progresses.
* __And 5 other cards at random.__

> Tip for player layout:
Do not group players from the same team together: alternate in the distribution, so that they feel concerned even when it is not their turn.

#### Important!
For the first variant, the objective will be, beyond the game, __to make the players discuss__ their experiences on the Internet, challenge them on their knowledge of the Internet, __identify with them the dangers of the Internet and draw from them the good practices__ and the good behaviours __ to adopt on the Internet.__.

Each round will thus give rise to a __exchange session__. This session will take place at the end of each round, once all the cards have been guessed.

The facilitator __has three rounds to cover all the topics,__ so don't try to cover them all in the first round. On the following pages you will find an explanation of how each round is conducted and a suggested breakdown of the exchanges between the different rounds.

For each word, a list of questions to ask in order to deduce together the good practices to adopt on the Internet is proposed at the end of the booklet.

__Be careful not to break the dynamics of the game with an exchange that is too long!__

#### At the end of each round
__At the end of each round, the facilitator must create a moment of exchange on several words__ (between one and four depending on the rhythm of the game). To do this, the facilitator takes the card to be discussed and __questions the players__, starting with a simple question: *How did you guess that word? *

Then, a set of questions can be asked to get the players to state by themselves the expected good practices.

At the end of the exchange, __the facilitator summarizes the good practices__ by echoing what was said!

> __At the end of the booklet, __for each word, there is a set of __questions and good practices to adopt__, which can be used as support for the facilitator. __It should therefore be consulted at the end of each round in order to be able to facilitate the exchange.__


## Round 1

__On each card there is a word in the center, which the player must make guess.__
To make the player guess this word, __the player is only allowed to speak,__ but as much as he wants.

__Derivatives of the word to be guessed or direct translations into another language are forbidden,__ under penalty of one point.

At the bottom of each card are also written __three words__. These words can be read aloud by the player to help him guess the central word. After each team has played once, the facilitator may decide to make the game more complex if he or she deems it necessary: the three words then become forbidden words: each forbidden word spoken will cost the team concerned one point.

When the 45 seconds of the round are over, the last card used must be placed in the middle of the remaining pile of cards. __It is forbidden to pass words,__ even in case of difficulty. This allows the players to make the words their own. If the word is not known to players, it is for example allowed to proceed by rebus.

Once all the cards have been guessed, the round is over. The moderator counts the points: __One point for each card guessed.__ Don't forget to deduct potential penalty points. The points are recorded on the scoreboard.

> __ On which words to bounce at the end of this round ?__
  Our recommendations: *Cyberstalking, Phishing, Virtual Friend, Challenge*

## Round 2

For this round, the player must __ make the player guess the words by drawing them . The same cards as in the first round are used.__

It is strictly forbidden to use letters in the drawing and to speak while drawing (under penalty of one point). As for the first round, rebus are allowed.
As in the first round, it is __prohibited to pass words__, even in case of difficulty.

Once all the cards have been guessed, the points are counted: __One point for each card guessed.__ Remember to deduct potential penalty points. These points are added up with those of the previous round.

> __ On which words to bounce at the end of this round ?__
  Our recommendations: *Blackmail, Fake news, Privacy.*

## Round 3

For this third and last round, the player must make the word on his __card guess by saying only one word.__

It is forbidden to use any of the words inscribed at the bottom of the card. Given the difficulty of the round, the player who makes the player guess __ is allowed to pass a maximum of two words__.

Once all the cards have been guessed, the points are scored: __one point per card guessed.__ Do not forget to deduct potential penalty points. These points are added up with those of the previous round to obtain totals.

The winning team is the one that collects the most points! __Congratulations to the winning team!__

> __ What words to bounce off at the end of this round? __
  Our recommendations: *Signal, Cell phone, Password*

----

#3 Wrap up - 20 min

The facilitator can start with a simple question: __Did you have a good time? What do you remember about it?__

Then, __he goes back over the following items,__ in the form of __ a summary__:

The __Internet is a really practical tool and offers a lot of possibilities___ to communicate, have fun, get informed, etc. 

__Unfortunately, it can also be used by ill-intentioned people__ who are capable of using all the means available to achieve their ends: cyberstalking, account hacking, password theft, identity theft, phishing, retrieving and using personal data, broadcasting fake news, etc.

Fortunately, a few __good practices and key reflexes__ will allow you to identify and thwart most traps.

#### How to conclude the game?
It is important to conclude the game with __a summary of the main concepts discussed during the session__, to confirm that the key messages have been understood.

#### Good practice reminder
A summary of these good practices is given on the following page.


-----

### What are the right attitudes to adopt?

* __If you have doubts about the intentions of a message received, the easiest thing to do is not to follow up.__ If you have doubts about the intentions of a message received, __ it is never too late: talk about it with people you trust. Depending on the case, a report can be made on the site www.internet.signalement.gouv.fr and assistance can be provided via www.cybermalveillance.gouv.fr.

* In general: __you are not alone !__ Victim or witness of abnormal behaviour, it is necessary and important to talk about it to find solutions: your parents, reporting, listening cells.

* __Restrict to only trusted people the personal or sensitive information that you would not want to see on the Internet__ : do not communicate this information to strangers, configure your security and confidentiality settings on social networks, disable geolocation of publicly shared photos, etc.

* __Protect access to your accounts__: your __passwords__ must remain secret under all circumstances, __complicated to guess for others and easy for you to remember.__ They must not be shared and must be changed regularly, as a precaution. To make them more secure, use long passwords rather than short ones and use a combination of lower case letters, capital letters, numbers and special characters.

> __ Now it's time to say goodbye, while asking one last time if the players have any questions or comments about this session and about cybersecurity more broadly.__
